2014_2015_2016_Auke_qPCR_supersimple_revision2.R contains the code used for the post-review version of the manuscript. The only real change is the use of log(Qcorr_qPCR) instead of Qcorr_qPCR as the predictor. This improved fit to zero count values.

2014_2015_2016_Auke_qPCR_supersimple.R contains the final code used for the analyses and figures included in "Environmental DNA for the enumeration and management of Pacific salmon" by Levi et al.

2014_2015_2016_Auke_qPCR.Rmd contains much additional code used during exploration of the two datasets, which are also included in this repo.

The submitted version of the manuscript is on Biorxiv. The manuscript is in press pending minor revisions at Molecular Ecology Resources (today's date is 14 Nov 2018).
